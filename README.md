# Personal data projects

- __Project Purpose:__ The goal of this project was to replicate a project I previously did in SAS for a previous class in Python. I wanted to demonstrate the ability to use many software to show adaptibility. The data I used was a previous dataset from the project. It is [LA Lakers basketball data](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAL/2018/gamelog/); I am their fan for sports, so I used their data. This is a project for my own prefrence. 
- __Tools used:__ I used Python with the packages of pandas, nupmy, and plotnine. The main script is used for the project is [ball.py](scripts/ball.py).
- __Results:__ The conclusion of this project is simple. I was not running any analysis, just creating the graphs. The process of creating them was a bit easy after learning R. I love how Python has the plotnine feature that is like ggplot of R. In this way, as I have not made these graphs in R yet, it was learning the process for both of the coding softwares. Next steps would learn to do a regression in Python, as I have done it in SAS and R already. Special note: favorite graph would be [Figure 16: Stacked Bar Chart](documents\f16_cohen_Python.png). This one was the 'most' difficult to do as finding the code for the percentage part was looking for online.

## Writing about data science

[Thusan's article on how writing about data science is not easy](https://towardsdatascience.com/lets-admit-it-writing-about-data-science-is-not-easy-37a376777d36) could be helpful as you document your project and skills.

## Data sources

You don't need to make these projects complicated. These projects are built to show your work using the skills you have developed during the course. I would make sure that these are presentable in your Github space. You want to demonstrate your creativity. You could use the following links to find a new data set. 

- [FiveThirtyEight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data)
- [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)
- [WorkoutWednesday](http://www.workout-wednesday.com/)
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- [data.world](https://data.world/search?context=community&entryTypeLabel=dataset&q=free+data&type=all)

## Github pages

It would help if you took the time to publish your repo for easier viewing of the files.  Please follow the directions at [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) to build your pages footprint on the internet.

## Questions

### Is the expectation of our personal projects similar to that of the class projects we are completing?

Yes & No. Here are a few points to highlight the comparison

1. Three different data sets is the main criteria. Hopefully different challenges to your skills and the data can be in the same area for all three if you desire.
2. You can choose the language. Please choose based on where you want employment.
3. We don't get much into the story telling with our class projects.  But, I would hope you tell a story that includes some graphs and analysis.
4. Think of these as sales pitches for future employment. Your personal projects should be in your own Github space.

# Personal data projects

- __Project Purpose:__ The goal of this project was to replicate a project I previously did in SAS for a previous class in Python. I wanted to demonstrate the ability to use many software to show adaptibility. The data I used was a previous dataset from the project. It is [LA Lakers basketball data](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAL/2018/gamelog/); I am their fan for sports, so I used their data. This is a project for my own prefrence. 
- __Tools used:__ I used Python with the packages of pandas, nupmy, and plotnine. The main script is used for the project is [ball.py](scripts/ball.py).
- __Results:__ The conclusion of this project is simple. I was not running any analysis, just creating the graphs. The process of creating them was a bit easy after learning R. I love how Python has the plotnine feature that is like ggplot of R. In this way, as I have not made these graphs in R yet, it was learning the process for both of the coding softwares. Next steps would learn to do a regression in Python, as I have done it in SAS and R already. Special note: favorite graph would be [Figure 16: Stacked Bar Chart](documents\f16_cohen_Python.png). This one was the 'most' difficult to do as finding the code for the percentage part was looking for online.
